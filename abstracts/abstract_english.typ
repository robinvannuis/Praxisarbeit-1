In order to efficiently develop new objects and features in ABAP CDS, it is essential to make decisions in such a way that they meet existing requirements while also antici-pating future needs. By analyzing historical metadata about these objects, valuable insights can be gained that help make these decisions more well-founded. The goal of this project is to develop a system that regularly reads out the required data and stores it in corresponding representations of the tables. Additionally, this system is supposed to assign a version for every new data-pull in order to make the historical development traceable. Ultimately, a framework should be developed that makes it possible for users able analyse this historical data through predefined queries. This will make it possible to obtain information about the individual objects and features not only in their current state, but also historically in earlier versions.
